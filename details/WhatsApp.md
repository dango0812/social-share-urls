## Description
WhatsApp's click to chat feature allows you to begin a chat with someone without having their phone number saved in your phone's address book. As long as you know this person‚Äôs phone number and they have an active WhatsApp account, you can create a link that will allow you to start a chat with them. By clicking the link, a chat with the person automatically opens. Click to chat works on both your phone and WhatsApp Web.

üí° The Chat on WhatsApp button is currently only available in English.  
To increase engagement using the Chat on WhatsApp button, follow these best practices:
- Use the button as is. Don't change the button.
- Use the latest version of the button. You can download the button designs here.
- Make sure the button is visible and easy to read.

You can use that Chat on WhatsApp button in many places, such as:
- landing pages on desktop browsers
- contact pages
- mobile apps
- mobile versions of your website
- templates from third-party developers
